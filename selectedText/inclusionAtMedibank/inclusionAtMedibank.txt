Inclusion at Medibank
We learn. We grow. We call out bias and encourage inclusion. We address pay equity, women and men in leadership, caring for kids, caring for family, disability, domestic and family violence. Wherever we are – with colleagues, customers or loved ones – we tackle the big issues.

Inclusion is our responsibility.

We challenge ourselves. We challenge each other. We challenge the way we see difference. Together, we can change the way one person, or an entire community, thinks or behaves.

We are here to push ourselves beyond our roles. To share our personal experiences. To be more open. To make every voice count. And in doing so, challenge who we become. As individuals, as an organisation, and as a society.
