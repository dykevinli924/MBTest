Our Commitment

We are committed to supporting and valuing a diverse workforce, which includes people from different cultural, ethnic, religious and national backgrounds and identities.

Weâ€™re proud we have a unique mix of employees from a diverse range of ethnicities and backgrounds. Around 22% of our extended leadership team do not identify as having an Australian, New Zealand or British background.

Medibank are also committed to advocating within our sphere of influence, by being intentional and explicit in our actions, and leading initiatives around cultural diversity and inclusion.

Our Actions

Celebrating our cultures throughout the year, recognising key festivals such as Chinese New Year and Diwali.
Participating in events such as A Taste of Harmony which celebrates diversity by encouraging colleagues to share food and stories from different cultural backgrounds from across the globe.
Challenging unconscious bias and casual racism.
Working to tailor our customer experience for our culturally diverse customers.
